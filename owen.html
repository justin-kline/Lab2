    <h3>Joy</h3>
    <p>it's when<br />your heart is full<br />and smiling<br />
      when life tries to<br />chip your happiness away<br />and it's courage<br />
      when fear tries to<br />take ahold of your direction<br />and it's peace<br />
      when nothing in your<br />life is stable<br />and it is love in your bones<br />
      when the rest of the<br />is telling you no</p>
