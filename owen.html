    <h2>Highlighted Work</h2>
    <h3>Dulce et Decorum Est</h3>
    <p>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br />
      Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br />
      Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs<br />
      And towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br />
      Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots<br />
      But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;<br />
      Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br />
      Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.<br />
      <br />
      Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling,<br />
      Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;<br />
      But someone still was yelling out and stumbling<br />
      And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime...<br />
      Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,<br />
      As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.<br />
      <br />
      In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,<br />
      He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.<br />
      <br />
      If in some smothering dreams you too could pace<br />
      Behind the wagon that we flung him in,<br />
      And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br />
      His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;<br />
      If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood<br />
      Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br />
      Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br />
      Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—<br />
      My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br />
      To children ardent for some desperate glory,<br />
      The old Lie: <i>Dulce et decorum est</i><br />
      <i>Pro patria mori.</i></p>
